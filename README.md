# My-First-App-Pomodoro

A simple pomodoro timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- color of the time was changed to purple
- family fonrt was changed to intel.
  I've made the following changes to create consistent vertical spacing:
  Changed the h1 margin from margin-bottom: 2rem to margin: 2rem 0 to add equal spacing above and below
  Updated the controls margin from 1rem to 2rem to match other elements
  Updated the mode-switches margin from 1rem to 2rem to match other elements
  Now all elements should have consistent 2rem (32px) spacing between them, creating a more balanced and visually appealing layout. Would you like me to make any adjustments to this spacing?
